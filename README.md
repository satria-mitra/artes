## ARTES - Augmented Reality Tiles for Environmental Sensing :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: :seedling:

# About

ARTES has been developed for the [EAST SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAMME 2021](https://www.queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/our-story/supporting-communities/education-and-young-people/east-education-summer-school), 26 July â€“ 6 August 2021


Discover how to build a simple soil sensor prototype to make sure your plants are getting the right amount of light and water, and design an AR (augmented reality) marker using mosaic tiles. In this hands-on creative tech space you will learn how to make your marker come to life by making it interactive, pull in data from the sensors, and access it via a smartphone. You will also have the opportunity to ask questions and find out more about the application of similar technologies in cutting edge research projects by members of the Connected Environments Lab, such as the bat boxes in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
